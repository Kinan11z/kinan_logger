Here I used the logger library in order to add improvements to the code and ease of use

## Features

1- It contains special methods to work with the Dio library

2- It contains a special method to handle a shared_preferences library

3- It contains several printing functions

4- It contains a function to print each level into a separate file

## Getting started

Just create an instance of Logger and start logging:

var logger = Logger();
